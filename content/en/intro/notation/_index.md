## Alternative notation

Besides thinking of partitions as a sequence of summands (parts), we may encode the data in a handful of other ways. This can be useful for computation, compactness, or for realizing the appearance of partitions in other areas of mathematics.

In fact, the cycle of discovery often begins with mathematicians studying an object of interest in their own field, only later realizing that after a little bit of manipulation the problem at hand can also be viewed in terms of partitions.

The most simple alternative notation to listing by parts is the so-called exponential notation, where we instead count the multiplicity of parts of a given size within our partition.

We also discuss Frobenius coordinates, Maya diagrams (zero-one sequences), and Dyck words.

## Interchanging between notations

We can prove that these notations are equivalent and that we can freely interchange between them, i.e. that the set of partitions is in bijection with the set of e.g. Frobenius coordinates

We also demonstrate and explain how these have been implemented in SageMath
