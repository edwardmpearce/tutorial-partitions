## Partition Statistics

Now that we have discussed many different ways of thinking about partitions, we move on to discussing properties (or statistics) of partitions, and how to calculate them.

## Calculating from different notations

We can prove that these notations are equivalent and that we can freely interchange between them, i.e. that the set of partitions is in bijection with the set of e.g. Frobenius coordinates

We also demonstrate and explain how these have been implemented in SageMath
